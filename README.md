# Dynamic-Programming-Knapsack-Problem
Using Dynamic Programming (DP) method to optimize Knapsack Problem for Amazon shopping list.

I collected data of 30 different items from Amazon.com including price of item, discount on that item and price before discount.
Because of limited budget ($1000), I can't buy all the items I want.
Yet, I want to buy those items from 30 items such that total discount I get will be maximum.

I formulated problem in 0/1 knapsack model and used dynamic programming to solve the problem.
I have attached code in python, data, data source and execution results in this repos.
