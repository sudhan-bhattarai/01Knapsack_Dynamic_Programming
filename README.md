# Dynamic-Programming-Knapsack-Problem
Using Dynamic Programming (DP) method to optimize Knapsack Problem for Amazon shopping list.

I collected data of 30 different items from Amazon.com including price of the items, discount on those items and the price before discount.
Because of a limited budget ($1000), I can't buy all the items I want.
Yet, I want to buy those items from 30 items such that total discount I get will be maximum.

I formulated the problem in a 0/1 knapsack model and used dynamic programming to solve it.
I have attached the code in python3, data, data source and execution results in this repository.
